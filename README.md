# 🩺 Diabetes Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify whether a patient has diabetes, based on medical records. It uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Diagnose Diabetes**: Use patient medical records to classify if an individual has diabetes.  
This is a binary classification problem where:
- `1` indicates the patient is diabetic
- `0` indicates the patient is non-diabetic

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **File:** `2. Diagnose Diabetes.csv`
- **Target Column:** `Outcome`
- **Feature Columns:** Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📦 Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or open in Google Colab.

Make sure the file 2. Diagnose Diabetes.csv is present.

Run the script diabetes_classifier.py or the Colab notebook.

If using Google Colab, it will prompt you to upload the CSV file.
